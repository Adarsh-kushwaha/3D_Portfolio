      <h2>📜 About Me</h2>
      I'm a teacher and developer who enjoys coding, especially when it comes to creating awesome websites. Nothing
      satisfies me more than creating new things and working on unique ideas. Creating things from the ground up and
      sweating it out until it is ready for production is my core strength.
      In 2019, I began as a wordpress developer and then shifted to react develoment and now I am a full time react
      developer.
